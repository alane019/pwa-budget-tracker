##  Overview <a name = "overview"></a>

PWA Budget Tracker is simple utility for keeping track of your personal finances. In order to provide a seamless online/offline experience, this project utilizes what are known as progressive web application technologies, including service workers and IndexedDB for storing data when if the web client loses it's connection to the web. In today's landscape of increasingly mobile and dispersed technology usage, these types of technologies will surely become a standard that users expect in the near future.
